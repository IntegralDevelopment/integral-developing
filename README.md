# integral-developing
<i>Building a constructive attitude, and tools for a better world</i>

&nbsp;

This repository is created to develop collectively an integral approach to Living as a whole, redefining verbs as <a href="https://github.com/bum2/integral-developing/blob/master/arts.md">Arts</a> as a first step and then going deeper into <a href="https://github.com/bum2/integral-developing/blob/master/ethics.md">Ethics</a>, into the <a href="https://github.com/bum2/integral-developing/blob/master/brains.md">Brains</a>, and into how we can organize the kinds of <a href="https://github.com/bum2/integral-developing/blob/master/integral-data.md">Data</a> from an integral perspective, helping the rise of a common integral forest of shared data-types trees. 

Also here we can try to sum-up (and join forces for a common good) all the existent and different "integral" attempts or points of view in the world, like the so called 'Integral Revolution', the so called 'Integral Theory', the concept of the 'Commons', etc. Trying to focus on a realistic world-centric approach about everything, post ego-centric and post etno-centric, post-capitalist and post-statist, and trying to copy and learn from Nature.
