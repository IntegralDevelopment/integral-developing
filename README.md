<i>Building a constructive attitude, and tools for a better world</i>

&nbsp;
his repository was created to collectively develop an integral and healthy approach to Living as a whole, distilling a set of basic [Principles](/principles.md) to improve human relations, one of the major sources of many projects' failure. The first step is
 redefining verbs as [Arts](/.arts.md) then going in depth into [Ethics](/ethics.md) and [Brains](/brains.md), then on how to organize all types of [Data](/integral-data.md) from an *integral* perspective with the aim to build a p2p [Common Database](/commonDBnet.md) network to facilitate the growing of a common integral forest of shared data-types trees and modular tools. 
 
A further action to perform here, join forces for a common good, could be trying to combine the different "integral" attempts or integral views all around the world, like the so-called 'Integral Revolution', the so-called 'Integral Theory', the concept of the 'Commons', etc. 
The purpose would be to focus on a realistic world-centric approach, post ego-centric and post etno-centric, post-capitalist and post-statist, by trying to copy and learn from Nature.
