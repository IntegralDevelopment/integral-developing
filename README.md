<i>Building a constructive attitude, and tools for a better world</i>

&nbsp;

This repository was created to develop collectively an integral and healthy approach to Living as a whole by distilating a set of basic [Principles](/principles.md) to improve human relations, the main cause of most project's failure). The first step would be redefining verbs as [Arts](/.arts.md), then to deepen with [Ethics](/ethics.md), with [Brains](/brains.md), and to carry on in the search of a way to organize all different types of of [Data](/integral-data.md) from an integral perspective to build a p2p [Common Database](/commonDBnet.md) network, helping the rise of a common integral forest of shared data-types trees and modular tools. 

In addition, we could try here we can try to sum-up and combine the effort made in the past in the name of the common good; all the  different "integral" attempts or similar visions all over the world, such as the so called 'Integral Revolution', the so called 'Integral Theory', the same concept of the 'Commons', etc. 

The aim is to focus on a realistic world-centric approach to the whole, post ego-centric and post etno-centric, post-capitalist and post-statist, in the effort to learn from Nature and imitate the ways in which it is tructured.
